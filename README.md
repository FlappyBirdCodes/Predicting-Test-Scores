# Predicting-Test-Scores
In this program, I used linear regression to try to predict the test scores of a student. The code was written in python and used the scikit-learn machine learning library.

# Data cleaning
A large portion of the data in the csv file was in the wrong format, so I had to clean this data and convert it into integers, as the algorithm is unable to read and decipher letters or words. 

# Errors and underfitting
Some of the columns in the csv file were irrelevant and decreased the accuracy of the algorithm, so I removed them.

# Algorithm training
In linear regression, data is split into training and testing data, often at a 80/20 ratio respectively. Once the algorithm was trained, we could pass in new inputs and it'd be able to predict a test score.

# Conclusion
Although the accuracy rate of the algorithm isn't very good, this was my first time experimenting with machine learning and AI in general.
